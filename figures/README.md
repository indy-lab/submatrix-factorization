# Generate Figures

Each script in this folder takes two arguments:
1. Some data as input
2. A path to a PDF file as output

For example, to plot the performance of our algorithm and the baselines for the US:
~~~
python us-results.py path/to/testUS.pkl path/to/us-results.pdf
~~~
The `testUS.pkl` file has been generated by `python run_benchmark.py --name testUS ...` (see [README.md](../README.md)).
