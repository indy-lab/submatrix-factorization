## Quick Links

- The real-time data for Switzerland are available in a [Zenodo repo](https://zenodo.org/record/3984924).
- The platform for real-time vote predictions in Switzerland is available at [www.predikon.ch](http://www.predikon.ch).
- Here is a [PDF version](https://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/278872) of the paper.
- The [`swissvotes`](https://github.com/victorkristof/swissvotes) library provides a scraper for the real-time Swiss referendum vote results.  
- The [`predikon`](https://github.com/indy-lab/predikon) library provides a standalone implementation of the algorithm proposed in the paper:
```
pip install predikon
```
